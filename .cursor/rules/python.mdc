# Dependency Information

- Assume Pydantic v2 is being used. 
- Assume LangChain and LangGraph are being used.

# General Python Rules

- Prioritize readability above all else. Rely on the human in the loop to provide optimizations as needed.
- Always import the fully qualified path.
- Suggest builtins and commonly used libraries over bespoke implementations of common algorithms.
- Always prefer builtins over `typings` imports.
  - For example, `list` over `List`, `dict` over `Dict`, `tuple` over `Tuple`, `X | Y` over `Union[X, Y]`, etc.
  - The only exception to this rule is that `Optional` is better than `| None`, as it's easier to read.
- Always indent with 2 spaces
